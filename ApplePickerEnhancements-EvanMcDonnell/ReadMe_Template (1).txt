___What are the controls to your game? How do we play?___


You use the mouse to move a basket around to catch apples from a moving tree.

___What creative additions did you make? How can we find them?___

I made it so that the speed the tree moves at, and the rate at which apples fall increase from every apple you collect.
I also added purple poison apples and golden apples that grant more score.


___Any assets used that you didn't create yourself? (art, music, etc. Just tell us where you got it, link it here)___

None.


___Did you receive help from anyone outside this class? (list their names and what they helped with)___

I did not

___Did you get help from any AI Code Assistants? (Tell us which .cs file to look in for the citation and describe what you learned)___

No

___Did you get help from any online websites, videos, or tutorials? (link them here)___

I did not use any websites for this one.


___What trouble did you have with this project?___

Figuring out how to add more baskets from catching a golden apple, which I could not figure out how to do.

___Is there anything else we should know?___

Nothing else
